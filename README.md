# Project detect malware
# Descriptions
This project is built to classify APK files into two categories: benign and malicious, using the Random Forest method. Information about permissions and application programming interfaces (APIs) is extracted from each APK file and used as features for the model. The model is trained on a large and diverse dataset of correctly labeled APK files. When a new APK file is available, the model will predict whether it is benign or malicious based on the features extracted from this file.
